# Certainly! Here's a Python code snippet that opens Google Chrome using the `webbrowser` module:

# ```python
# import webbrowser

# chrome_path = 'C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s'  # Path to your Chrome executable
# url = 'https://www.google.com'  # URL to open in Chrome

# webbrowser.get(chrome_path).open(url)
# ```

# Please make sure to replace the `chrome_path` variable with the correct path to your Chrome executable.
